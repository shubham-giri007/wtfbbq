            <h2>About the clan</h2>
            <p>
                We are a level 20 champs II "casual" war clan;too sexy for our shirts and hellbent on CoC destruction!
                <br>
                <div> Losing a war isn't the end of the world but we are a strong group that follow a war plan. </div>
                 We usually match tough opponents and thrive on the challenge - with an 80% win ratio and 620+
                 
                   <div> It should be clear that we know what it takes to be victorious in war.</div>  <br>
                  We war 3x/week (spin on Sun/Tues/Fri) except during Clan War League events or the occasional Potluck.
                  <div>

                    We are 100% fair play - no modding, botting, etc. is allowed. 
                    Also, we do not take in engineered/.5 bases so if engineering is your thing, please don't waste your time or ours.
                    </div>
